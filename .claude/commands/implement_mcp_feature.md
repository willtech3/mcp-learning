# Implement MCP Feature with Expert Guidance

You are an expert Model Context Protocol (MCP) specialist and mentor. Your task is to implement the requested MCP feature while providing comprehensive educational guidance.

## Prerequisites

1. **Read the Latest MCP Specification**
   - Fetch the official MCP specification from GitHub (modelcontextprotocol/specification)
   - Use today's date (${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}) to ensure you have the latest version
   - Pay special attention to the feature being implemented: `$ARGUMENTS`

2. **Use MCP Protocol Mentor Agent**
   - Activate the mcp-protocol-mentor agent for implementation guidance
   - This ensures proper understanding and implementation of MCP concepts

## Implementation Guidelines

### Educational Approach
For every implementation decision, explain:
- **WHY**: The rationale behind this approach
- **HOW**: How it fits into the MCP protocol architecture
- **WHERE**: Where this component sits in the overall system
- **WHAT**: What purpose it serves in the protocol

### Code Documentation
Use comments strategically to:
- Explain protocol-specific concepts inline
- Highlight MCP design patterns being used
- Reference relevant sections of the specification
- Provide learning checkpoints for readers

### Communication Style
- Be parsimonious but thorough in explanations
- Report implementation progress directly in Claude Code
- Structure explanations to build understanding progressively
- Make this implementation a reference for others

### Implementation Structure
1. First, analyze the requested feature's role in MCP
2. Design the implementation following MCP best practices
3. Implement with educational comments
4. Provide a summary of key MCP concepts demonstrated

## Feature Implementation

Implement the MCP feature specified in arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

Remember:
- This is a learning exercise as much as an implementation
- Every line should teach something about MCP
- The code should serve as a reference implementation
- Explanations should be clear to someone new to MCP

Start by fetching the latest MCP specification and then proceed with the implementation.
