## Introduction

Security is foundational to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). As MCP enables AI applications to access sensitive data and tools, robust security practices are essential to protect users, organizations, and systems from threats. This document outlines best practices for securing MCP implementations, drawing from the protocolâ€™s design, industry standards, and real-world deployments.

## Security Principles

MCP is designed with security as a core principle:
- **Security by Default**: All operations require explicit permissions; no implicit trust.
- **Capability-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for every operation.
- **Auditability**: All sensitive operations are logged for traceability.
- **Transport Agnostic Security**: Security is enforced regardless of the underlying transport.
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is exposed to clients.

## Authentication

Robust authentication ensures only authorized entities can access MCP servers:
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Use bearer tokens (e.g., JWT) for API access. Rotate and expire tokens regularly.
- **Certificate-Based Authentication (mTLS)**: Use mutual TLS for strong, certificate-based identity verification between clients and servers.
- **OAuth 2.0**: For third-party integrations, leverage OAuth 2.0 flows to delegate access securely.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Where possible, require MFA for administrative operations.

## Authorization

MCP supports multiple authorization models:
- **Capability-Based**: Grant permissions to specific actions (e.g., read, write, execute) on resources and tools.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assign roles (e.g., admin, user, guest) with predefined permission sets.
- **Resource-Based**: Control access at the level of individual resources (e.g., files, APIs).
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Always grant the minimum permissions necessary for each client or user.

## Data Protection

Protecting data is critical throughout its lifecycle:
- **Encryption in Transit**: Use TLS (or mTLS) for all communications between clients and servers.
- **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data stored by MCP servers.
- **Data Minimization**: Only expose the minimum data required for each operation.
- **Audit Logging**: Log all access to sensitive resources and tools, including who accessed what and when.
- **Secure Defaults**: Disable insecure protocols and ciphers; require strong encryption by default.

## Secure Development Practices

Follow these practices when developing MCP servers and clients:
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs from clients to prevent injection and other attacks.
- **Error Handling**: Avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities.
- **Security Testing**: Perform regular security assessments, including penetration testing and code reviews.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure the system fails securely if a security control cannot be enforced.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

Be aware of these common threats and how to address them:
- **Replay Attacks**: Use nonces/timestamps in requests and reject duplicates.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Enforce strict permission checks on every operation.
- **Injection Attacks**: Sanitize and validate all user input.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Require TLS/mTLS for all connections.
- **Insecure Defaults**: Review and harden default configurations before deployment.
- **Insufficient Logging**: Ensure all sensitive actions are logged and logs are protected from tampering.

## Compliance and Auditability

MCP can help organizations meet regulatory and compliance requirements:
- **Comprehensive Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed logs of all access and operations.
- **Traceability**: Ensure every action can be traced to an authenticated identity.
- **Data Residency and Retention**: Respect data residency requirements and implement data retention/deletion policies.
- **Regulatory Alignment**: Align with standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, and others as required.
