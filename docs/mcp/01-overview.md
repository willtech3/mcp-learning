## Introduction

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol designed to standardize how Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI applications connect to various data sources, tools, and systems. Developed by Anthropic and released as an open standard, MCP serves as the "USB-C port for AI applications" - providing a universal way to connect AI systems to the context they need.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open-source protocol that enables:
- **Standardized Integration**: A consistent way for AI applications to access external data and tools
- **Universal Connectivity**: Like USB standardized physical connections, MCP standardizes AI-to-system connections
- **Context Provisioning**: Secure, standardized method to provide AI systems with the context they need

### Key Statistics (as of 2025)
- **9** Official SDKs
- **1000+** Available Servers
- **70+** Compatible Clients
- **208** Contributors on GitHub
- **4.8k** GitHub Stars

## Why MCP?

Traditional AI applications face several limitations:
1. **Manual Context**: Limited to information users manually provide
2. **Bespoke Integrations**: Each integration requires custom development
3. **Security Concerns**: No standardized security practices for data access
4. **Vendor Lock-in**: Switching LLM providers requires rewriting integrations

MCP solves these problems by providing:
- A growing ecosystem of pre-built integrations
- Flexibility to switch between LLM providers
- Built-in security best practices
- Standardized development patterns

## Key Features

### 1. **Client-Server Architecture**
- Clean separation between AI applications (clients) and data/tool providers (servers)
- Multiple clients can connect to multiple servers
- Supports both local and remote connections

### 2. **Protocol Components**
- **Resources**: Expose data (similar to REST GET endpoints)
- **Tools**: Provide functionality with side effects (similar to REST POST endpoints)
- **Prompts**: Reusable templates for LLM interactions
- **Sampling**: Server-driven LLM completions

### 3. **Transport Flexibility**
- **stdio**: Process-based communication via standard input/output
- **HTTP with SSE**: Web-based transport with Server-Sent Events
- **Streamable HTTP**: Efficient streaming for large responses

### 4. **Security-First Design**
- Capability-based permissions
- Secure authentication mechanisms
- Controlled data access patterns
- Audit trail support

## Core Concepts

### MCP Hosts
Applications that want to access data through MCP. Examples:
- Claude Desktop
- VS Code with Copilot
- Custom AI applications

### MCP Clients
Protocol clients within host applications that manage connections to servers. They handle:
- Connection lifecycle
- Message routing
- Capability negotiation
- Error handling

### MCP Servers
Programs that expose specific capabilities to clients. They can:
- Provide access to data (files, databases, APIs)
- Execute actions (create, update, delete operations)
- Integrate with external services
- Implement custom business logic

### Resources
Data exposed by servers that clients can read. Examples:
- File contents
- Database records
- API responses
- System information

### Tools
Functions that servers expose for clients to execute. Examples:
- File operations (create, update, delete)
- Database queries
- API calls
- System commands

### Prompts
Pre-defined templates that guide LLM interactions. They can include:
- Dynamic arguments
- Contextual information
- Structured output formats

## How MCP Works

### Step 1: Choose MCP Servers
Select from pre-built servers or create custom ones:
- **Pre-built servers**: GitHub, Google Drive, Slack, PostgreSQL, etc.
- **Custom servers**: Build your own for proprietary systems

### Step 2: Connect AI Applications
Configure your AI application to connect to MCP servers:
```python
# Example: Connecting to an MCP server
from mcp import McpClient

client = McpClient(
    name="my-ai-app",
    version="1.0.0"
)

await client.connect(
    server_command="uvx",
    args=["mcp-server-github"]
)
```

### Step 3: Work with Context
AI applications can now:
- Access real-time data from connected systems
- Execute actions based on user requests
- Combine information from multiple sources
- Maintain context across conversations

## Industry Adoption

### 2025 Milestones

**March 2025**: OpenAI officially adopted MCP, integrating it across:
- ChatGPT Desktop App
- OpenAI's Agents SDK
- Responses API

**April 2025**: Google DeepMind announced MCP support for upcoming Gemini models, with CEO Demis Hassabis describing it as "rapidly becoming an open standard for the AI agentic era"

**April 2025**: GitHub released an official MCP Server written in Go, developed in collaboration with Anthropic

### Major Adopters
- **Anthropic**: Original creator, integrated in Claude Desktop
- **OpenAI**: Full platform integration
- **Google DeepMind**: Gemini model support
- **Microsoft**: Official C# SDK partnership
- **Shopify**: Official Ruby SDK partnership
- **Spring AI**: Official Java SDK partnership

## Getting Started

### For Users
1. **Use MCP-enabled applications**: Claude Desktop, VS Code with Copilot
2. **Install pre-built servers**: Available via npm, pip, or other package managers
3. **Configure connections**: Follow app-specific setup guides

### For Developers
1. **Choose your role**:
   - **Server Developer**: Build servers to expose your data/tools
   - **Client Developer**: Create AI applications that consume MCP
   
2. **Select an SDK**:
   - Python (includes FastMCP high-level API - recommended for this project)
   - TypeScript/JavaScript
   - C# (.NET)
   - Ruby
   - Java
   - Go (coming soon)

3. **Follow the guides**:
   - Server Development Guide
   - Client Development Guide
   - Security Best Practices

### Quick Example: Building a Simple Server

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
import json

# Create server instance
mcp = FastMCP(
    name="my-server",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# Expose a resource
@mcp.resource("users")
async def get_users():
    """Get user information"""
    users = await fetch_users()
    return [
        {
            "type": "text",
            "text": json.dumps(users)
        }
    ]

# Start the server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```
