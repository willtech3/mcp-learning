# Virtual Library MCP Server

A comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation that simulates a complete library management system. This server serves as both a learning tool and a reference implementation for MCP concepts.

## 🆕 Protocol 2026-07-28 (dual-era)

This server now speaks **two MCP protocol eras on one endpoint**: the legacy
`initialize`-handshake protocol (2025-11-25, via FastMCP) *and* the new
**stateless [2026-07-28](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft)
revision**, implemented from scratch in [`modern/`](modern/) for teaching —
`server/discover`, per-request `_meta`, MRTR, `subscriptions/listen`,
CacheableResult, the SEP-2640 skills extension, the tasks extension, and the
draft authorization model (with a built-in demo authorization server).

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- uv (package manager)
- just (task runner)

### Common Tasks

```bash
just test         # Run test suite
just lint         # Check code style
just typecheck    # Run type checking
just format       # Format code
just dev-debug    # Run with debug logging
```

### Testing the Server

The server uses stdio transport and expects JSON-RPC messages:

```bash
# Send an initialization request
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "initialize", "params": {"protocolVersion": "1.0"}, "id": 1}' | just dev
```

## 🔄 Async/Sync Architecture Pattern

### Understanding the Mixed Async/Sync Approach

This MCP server uses a specific pattern that might seem unusual at first: **async handlers with synchronous database operations**. This is intentional and correct for our use case.

#### Why Async Handlers?

MCP protocol and FastMCP require async handlers because:
- The protocol layer needs non-blocking I/O for handling multiple concurrent requests
- Long-running operations shouldn't block other requests
- Future operations might need async capabilities (external APIs, etc.)

#### Why Sync Database Operations?

We use synchronous SQLAlchemy with SQLite because:
- SQLite is a local, file-based database with fast operations
- Async SQLite provides no performance benefit (still single-threaded)
- Synchronous code is simpler to understand and debug
- SQLAlchemy's sync API is more mature and well-documented

#### The Pattern in Practice

```python
# MCP requires async handlers
async def list_books_handler(
    uri: str,
    context: Context,
    params: BookListParams | None = None,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    # But we can use sync operations inside
    with session_scope() as session:  # Sync context manager
        repo = BookRepository(session)
        result = repo.search(...)     # Sync database query
        return result.model_dump()    # Return sync result from async function
```

#### Key Points

1. **This is not a mistake** - Async functions can contain sync code
2. **Performance is fine** - SQLite operations are fast enough to not block
3. **Future flexibility** - Easy to add async operations later if needed
4. **Best of both worlds** - Protocol compliance + implementation simplicity

#### When to Use Full Async

You would use async all the way down when:
- Using PostgreSQL/MySQL with async drivers (asyncpg, aiomysql)
- Making external HTTP API calls
- Dealing with slow I/O operations
- Handling many concurrent database connections

For a learning project with SQLite, the mixed approach provides the best balance of correctness and simplicity.
